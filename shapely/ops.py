        Splits a geometry by another geometry and returns a collection of geometries. This function is the theoretical
        opposite of the union of the split geometry parts. If the splitter does not split the geometry, a collection
        with a single geometry equal to the input geometry is returned.

          - Splitting a (Multi)LineString by a (Multi)Point or (Multi)LineString or (Multi)Polygon

        It may be convenient to snap the splitter with low tolerance to the geometry. For example in the case
        of splitting a line by a point, the point must be exactly on the line, for the line to be correctly split.
        When splitting a line by a polygon, the boundary of the polygon is used for the operation.
        When splitting a line by another line, a ValueError is raised if the two overlap at some segment.
